#Overview:
Scaffolds And Widgets is a simple Flutter project that serves as a great starting point for beginners learning Flutter development. The project demonstrates the usage of scaffolds and widgets to create a basic mobile application. The code is structured in a way that is easy to understand and provides a minimalistic mobile app.

#Features:
Scaffold Structure
The app employs the scaffold structure with an app bar, body, and a floating action button.

App Bar:
The app bar includes a centered title, enhancing the overall visual appeal. The title text is styled with a bold font and a custom color.

Body Content:
The body of the app contains a centered image widget, creating a visually appealing and straightforward user interface.

Floating Action Button:
A floating action button is added with a customized label, style, and a simple print statement on press.

#Flutter Hot Reload and Hot Restart:
One of the powerful features of Flutter is its hot reload and hot restart capabilities, which significantly speed up the development process.

Hot Reload: With hot reload, you can instantly see the effects of the code changes you make. It allows you to experiment, add features, and fix bugs faster by injecting updated code into the running Dart Virtual Machine (VM).

Hot Restart: Hot restart goes a step further by restarting the entire application, including the Dart VM. It's useful when you want to reset the app's state entirely.
